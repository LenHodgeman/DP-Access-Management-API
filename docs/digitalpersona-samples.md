## Sample Applications

The DigitalPersona Sample Applications illustrate use of the web and native Windows APIs for enrollment, authentication and device access.

[Could use additional high-level content, but not duplicating or overlapping the main content on the authentication repo.]

Each sample application is available in its own repository.
