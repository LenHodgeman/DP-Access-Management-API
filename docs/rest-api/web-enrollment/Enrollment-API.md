# Web Enrollment Services API

The DigitalPersona Web Enrollment Services (WES) API allows you to add enrollment and management of DigitalPersona credentials to your web-based application. Significant features of the DigitalPersona WES API include:  

- Creation and deletion of a user account in the DigitalPersona database  
- Enrollment, unenrollment and re-enrollment of DigitalPersona credentials*  
- Capturing and saving additional user biographic information such as user surname, date of birth, email address, etc.  

The actual API and accompanying documentation are in a separate GIT repo.
