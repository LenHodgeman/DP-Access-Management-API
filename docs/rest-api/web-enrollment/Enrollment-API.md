# Web Enrollment Services API

The DigitalPersona Web Enrollment Services (WES) API allows you to add enrollment and management of DigitalPersona credentials to your web-based application. Significant features of the DigitalPersona WES API include:  

- Creation and deletion of a user account in the DigitalPersona database  
- Enrollment, unenrollment and re-enrollment of DigitalPersona credentials*  
- Capturing and saving additional user biographic information such as user surname, date of birth, email address, etc.  

This version of the DigitalPersona WES API supports the following DigitalPersona credentials:  

- Password
- Fingerprint
- PIN
- Proximity Cards
- Live Questions

Support for web-based management of additional credentials such as Smart Card and Bluetooth devices is planned, but these additional credentials are only supported locally at this time.  

The API uses the Microsoft Web Server (Internet Information Services (IIS)) as a hosting environment and Microsoft WCF as a framework for the building environment.   

Note: Use of this API requires previous installation and configuration of the DigitalPersona Web Management Components. For details, see the DigitalPersona Administrator Guide.

## Target Audience
This guide is for developers who have a working knowledge of the C++ programming language. In addition, readers must have an understanding of the DigitalPersona product and its authentication terminology and concepts.
